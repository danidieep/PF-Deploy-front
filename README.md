## Introduction

This repository is the frontend of a project that I did with my partners. This project is a website where we sell artwork.
Im decided to separate the repositorie of the project in the folder of backend and the frontend because its easier for the deveployment.
For the deployment of this folder, I used a site called Vercel.
You can visit the repository of the backend in my profile if you wish.
